Need to define how some stuff will work, how I would want some stuff to work...

How will users be? Will I implement auth straight away? Could it be something
local based if the user chooses so?

### think things
Will probably make it a self-host docker based thing and will think about doing
anything else more complext later

- create dockerfiles and docker-compose file (Add create.sql in init sql
postgres thing)
